# CODE JATT Tiger Vision Hub üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: CODE JATT

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Liya S Chittilappilly - Vidya Academy of Science and Technology

### Project Description
A powerful computer vision platform that brings Tiger-style precision to image and video analysis. The hub processes visual data with deadly accuracy, detecting everything from abs to raindrops with the ferocity of a tiger on the hunt.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world filled with ordinary computer vision tools, there's no platform that captures the raw power and intensity of a tiger's vision. Existing solutions are too tame, too gentle, lacking the killer instinct needed for truly ferocious image analysis.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
CODE JATT Tiger Vision Hub - a computer vision platform that doesn't just see, but hunts. Each algorithm is fine-tuned with predatory precision, delivering results with the speed and accuracy of a tiger's strike. From detecting abs to counting raindrops, every analysis is performed with the intensity of an action movie sequence.
